You can configure an individual repo to use a specific user / email address which overrides the global configuration. From the root of the repo, run

git config user.name "Your Name Here"
git config user.email your@email.com
whereas the default user / email is configured in your ~/.gitconfig

git config --global user.name "Your Name Here"
git config --global user.email your@email.com

So the gitconfig file in repo would have:
[user]
	name = codesmack
	email = akb81ster@gmail.com

Also add the following to the repo gitconfig file to remember your password:
[credential]
	helper = store
