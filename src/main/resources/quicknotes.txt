@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO) not working - section customizing mapping with metadata. also check the demo.
we got the error:
ERROR: could not read a hi value
com.mysql.jdbc.exceptions.jdbc4.MySQLSyntaxErrorException: Table 'jpa_core_style.hibernate_sequence' doesn't exist
The reason is:
It will look for how the database that you are using generates ids. For MySql or HSQSL, there are increment fields that automatically increment. In Postgres or Oracle, they use sequence tables. Since you didn't specify a sequence table name, it will look for a sequence table named hibernate_sequence and use it for default. So you probably don't have such a sequence table in your database and now you get that error.
Either add a hibernate_sequence or
your own sequence table and use the annotations to name your sequence table that you have.

Observations:
Without an auto increment generator in the DB, the generation type did not work at all. With it, the primary key was generated when used identity generation. Having an auto
increment and not having a generator also leads to error if PK is not provided.

changing the state of a persisted object in the scope of transaction start and commit will reflect in the DB.

Read more about @Generated value strategies.
